# HospitalManagementSystem
A Database management system, which makes it easy to control the database of the hospital.
This project was made as a semester project that used the SQL language commands through an application.
The main motive of this application is to show the connectivity of the Java Application to MySQL database.

This application controls the database using the MySQL commands that run in the swing project made in java.
I have used the Java SQL Connector in order to connect the database to the application.
The modules of Doctor login and patient login are not completed yet.

# How to run

To run the application, just open the project in any of the Java IDE, add the configurations to run the project.
Select Main.java as the main file in order to run the project.
The AdminLogin page appears, where the admin can login to open the Admin actions.
The login and password can be found in the database that is connected to the project.
